## Introduction

In this laboratory course, you will gain practical experience with the tools and methods for designing, simulating, and implementing digital circuits.  You will apply the concepts learned in lecture (ELC 2337) and produce working examples of combinational and sequential logic circuits.


## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will
- Be familiar with basic digital circuit building blocks (for example, decoders, multiplexers, shift registers) and be able to incorporate these fundamental logic circuits into larger, more complicated digital designs.
- Understand the electrical characteristics of fundamental combinational and sequential circuits and know how these characteristics impact digital designs.
- Be familiar with basic sequential circuit design methods and understand the use of flip-flops and latches.
<!-- - Know how to use modern software tools for designing and implementing digital systems. -->
- **Able to use Vivado to implment, simulate, test and debug a given digital circuit desgin**.
- Have a working knowledge of Verilog for designing and simulating digital circuits.
- Able to use block diagram to describe a given Verilog code and vice versa.
- Be able to communicate technical information more effectively.
- Know how to use git with some basic commands to trace your work.


## Github

I will be using [github classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to distribute the assignments and grade them. The grade will be posted on both your assignment repository's issue section and on Canvas. Students are required to learn git and github classroom.


## Lab Assignments

Each laboratory exercise will have an assignment with specific instructions. Assignments will be posted together with each lab on github. By default, each assignment is due in one week after each lab.


<!-- ## Laboratory Practical -->

<!-- The last lab (week of April 23) is laboratory practical which weights (15%) of the grade. Student will be asked to complete some given tasks based on what we have covered in this semester in limited time. Failing to attend lab practical will result a 'F' regardless of your lab assignments' grade. If there is a scheduling conflict, you need to let me know **at least a week in advance**. -->


## Grading

Grade will be completely based on your lab assignments. Lab 1-10 will each carry 10 points. Lab 11-12 will each carry 20 points. I will drop one of your lowest assignment from lab 1-10. Missing items will be assigned a grade of 0.  Missed lab exercises must be completed on your own time.  Any student **missing two or more labs will automatically fail the course**. Course grading scheme is show below.


|Letter Grade|Score Range|
|:-----------|:----------|
|A           |[94-100)   |
|A-          |[90-94)    |
|B+          |[87-90)    |
|B           |[83-87)    |
|B-          |[80-83)    |
|C+          |[77-80)    |
|C           |[73-77)    |
|C-          |[70-73)    |
|D+          |[67-70)    |
|D           |[63-67)    |
|D-          |[60-63)    |
|F           |[00-60)    |
